## PrepScholar Reviews - Testimonials (Reddit & Turstpilot)

Still on the fence about choosing PrepScholar as your companion to achieve your learning goals?

Letâ€™s look at some amazing PreScholar reviews from Reddit and Trustpilot.

[Twilak on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/w319ze/is_prepscholar_worth_it_is_it_good/) user is basically saying:

"If you don't want to overthink your SAT prep, PrepScholar is a solid choice. Just stick to their schedule, grind daily, and youâ€™ll likely see a 160+ point boost, but heads up it takes serious commitment. The site says you can master everything in 40 hours, but this user took 110. Also, while uWorld has better-quality practice problems, PrepScholar actually teaches you the lessons. So, if youâ€™ve got the budget and the patience, itâ€™s worth it!"
